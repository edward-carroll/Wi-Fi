Wi-Fi: What it is, Attacks, and Security

What is Wi-Fi

  Wi-Fi stands for Wireless Fidelity. It is a wireless networking technology that allows devices like smartphones, laptops, tablets, and smart TVs to connect to the           internet or communicate with each other without physical cables.

  Wi-Fi uses radio frequency (RF) signals — specifically the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands (and now 6 GHz with Wi-Fi 6E) — to transmit data between your device and a wireless       router or access point.

Wi-Fi provides wireless internet access to:

  Browse the web

  Stream video and music

  Use apps

  Send emails

  Access cloud-based files

  Communicate with smart home devices

  Instead of using Ethernet cables, it enables freedom of movement while staying connected.

Basic Wi-Fi Setup 

 1. Modem

    Connects your home to the internet via your Internet Service Provider (ISP).

    Usually plugs into your cable line or fiber.

  2. Router

    Connects to your modem and distributes internet access to devices.

    Provides a Wi-Fi signal throughout your home.

    Can also include firewall, DHCP (IP assignment), and NAT (network translation).

    Many modern devices are modem-router combos.

  3. Access Point (optional)

    Used to extend Wi-Fi coverage in larger homes or buildings.

    Also used in business networks to support more devices.

  4. Devices

    Laptops, smartphones, smart TVs, gaming consoles, etc., connect to the wireless network using the SSID (network name) and password.

Security Tip for Wi-Fi Setup

  Always do the following when setting up a new Wi-Fi network:

  Change the default admin username and password.

  Use WPA3 encryption if available (WPA2 at a minimum).

  Choose a strong network password.

  Disable WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) — it's often insecure.

  Hide your SSID broadcast if you want to make it less visible (optional).
